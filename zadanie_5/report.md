# Python Library Exploration – NumPy & Pandas (Expanded)

## NumPy
**Purpose**: High-performance numerical computing using arrays.

**Key Features**:
- Multidimensional array object
- Tools for integrating C/C++ code
- Linear algebra, FFT, random number generation

### Example 1: Array math
Square elements, element-wise operations on arrays.

### Example 2: Matrix operations
Inverse, dot product, transpose – common in data science and ML.

### Example 3: Statistics
Generate random samples and compute standard deviation.

## Pandas
**Purpose**: Data manipulation and analysis with structured tabular data.

**Key Features**:
- Fast and flexible DataFrame structure  
- Reading/writing CSV, Excel, SQL  
- Powerful group-by, filter, aggregate operations

### Example 1: Filtering DataFrames
Extract rows based on conditions.

### Example 2: Grouping and Aggregation
Summarize data by categories (e.g. total revenue by region).

### Example 3: Reading CSV with sales data
Load local sales data (e.g. from `sales.csv`) and compute the average sales in a given period.

## Why These Libraries?
Both libraries are essential in modern Python data science workflows. They are widely adopted, continuously developed, and extremely well-documented.

- **NumPy**: Foundation for numerical and scientific computing.
- **Pandas**: Backbone for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis.
